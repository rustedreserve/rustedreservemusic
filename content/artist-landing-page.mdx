<p>Thomas Hinds is a singer/songwriter out of the four corners area of New Mexico.
He has been playing and writing since high school and life has given him the opportunity
to get out and support his new album "Resurrection Road". "Resurrection Road" is his third
independant release, recorded at Kitchen Sink Studios in Santa Fe, New Mexico with
Jono Manson behind the board. This release is a step forward in letting the songs speak
for themselves, a stripped down collection of thirteen tracks that show you the bones that
inspired the stories found on this record.</p>
<p>Thomas will be on the road most of 2020. He has a catalog of originals that reflect a life
filled with love, loss, and the phases of heartache. Hinds' first release "Ghosts and Lamentations"
 was released in 2015, then in late 2017 he released an EP titled "Barbwire Bouquet" with two songs
recorded with Jono on that release, "Keep On" and a reworked "Favorite Hello" that was originally on
"Ghosts and Lamentations", who according to Jeffrey Foucault, "showed a lot of growth in the
songwriting". So, now with "Resurrection Road" a step towards solidifying his writing ability with a touch of Ray Lamontagne and Steve Earle in the fabric of the songs stretching out in this collection. 
</p><p>Thomas has relocated to northern Georgia and will be playing a lot of shows in that area, while 
working on a Midwest tour in March and an east coast run followed by a tour across the country and back 
starting in June. Be sure to catch a show if he is in your area and contact him if you are interested in hosting a house concert or have a venue looking for an original artist to play along his route.</p>
